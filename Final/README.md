dp - Death Process (Title is just dp as to not compromise the users experience. The title is inspired by the Heptapods translation of dying from Denis Villeneuve's Arrival).
 
The player escorts a character experiencing the beginning, middle, and end of my view on the series of events that occures when we die, if such a thing exists. 

Why this project:
I have wanted to make a narrative game for a while now and I thought this would be a good opportunity to get the ball rolling.
Making a game about the process of dying - The concept of dying is so unique to so many different people (ideologies, religion, what it means to be alive, what it means to be dead, anxieties towards death). It’s the question we all want the answer to and I think a video games is the perfect medium to discuss that topic.
Make a Unity 3D game on my own - I have made 2D unity games before and have only worked on the artistic side of Unity 3D games in the past. I wanted to finally get the expereience of building a 3D game from the ground up on my own.

It’s important to live a fulfilling life and I beleive you determine that based on what your definition of a fulfilling life is.
I wanted people to get meaningful reflection out of the game, to allow for a conversation about death that has become increasingly taboo in American society (this was a great point pointed out to me by Dr. Lohmeyer).

The stages of the game are as follows:

**Beginning Stage** - Confusion, questioning what is happening and where they are going.
 
**Middle Stage** - Panic/rejection fearing the worst... fearing that death is imminent. 


**End-Stage** - Acceptance... I know I am dying and this process can't be stopped. 

You will find all the project files and the data folder and exe needed to run the game. 

After building there is a strange camera stutter that occured when playing full screen. This was minimized by playing windowed, however I think the issue is due to a fixed timestep setting that I will fix the next time I have time to work on the game. 

The origional name of my game was Interactive Narration, that is why the project folder is named as such.
