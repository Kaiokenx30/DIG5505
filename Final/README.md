dp - Death Process (Title is just dp as to not compromise the users experience. The title is inspired by the Heptapods translation of dying from Denis Villeneuve's Arrival).
 
The player escorts a character experiencing the beginning, middle, and end of my view on the series of events that occures when we die, if such a thing exists. 

Why this project:
I have wanted to make a narrative game for a while now and I thought this would be a good opportunity to get the ball rolling.
Making a game about the process of dying - The concept of dying is so unique to so many different people (ideologies, religion, what it means to be alive, what it means to be dead, anxieties towards death). It’s the question we all want the answer to and I think a video games is the perfect medium to discuss that topic.
Make a Unity 3D game on my own - I have made 2D unity games before and have only worked on the artistic side of Unity 3D games in the past. I wanted to finally get the expereience of building a 3D game from the ground up on my own.

It’s important to live a fulfilling life and I beleive you determine that based on what your definition of a fulfilling life is.
I wanted people to get meaningful reflection out of the game, to allow for a conversation about death that has become increasingly taboo in American society (this was a great point pointed out to me by Dr. Lohmeyer).

The stages of the game are as follows:

**Beginning Stage** - Confusion, questioning what is happening and where they are going.
 
**Middle Stage** - Panic/rejection fearing the worst... fearing that death is imminent. 


**End-Stage** - Acceptance... I know I am dying and this process can't be stopped. 

You will find all the project files and the data folder and exe needed to run the game. 

After building there is a strange camera stutter that occured when playing full screen. This was minimized by playing windowed, however I think the issue is due to a fixed timestep setting that I will fix the next time I have time to work on the game. 

The origional name of my game was Interactive Narration, that is why the project folder is named as such. 

**About the programming for the game** The scripting for this game included a mix of pre existing scripts for character coliders and cameras as well as variations of scripts either found in tutorials (for example the fade to next level script and character controller),tutorials that laid the foundation of what I needed to accomplish and manipulated to fit my needs (the random movement script used on the 'bugs' in the first level), or deduced from trial and error by applying what I learned from the Unity documentation and other sources online (for example the character animator which tripped me up way more than I thought it would). Anything having to do with chracter animations is what tripped me up the most during this project, fortunately it was something small that I over looked that took me a while to identify most of the time. Another large hurdle was in research; finding resources that seemed like a solid solution only to find out that it wouldn't work with the version of Unity I was using. Programming is so unique in that it can take you hours to figure out one specific thing, but once you have figured it out it all makes sense and you could re-create it in a matter of minutes.  

At the beginning of the course I talked about how programming has been the part of design that has always slowed down my creativity and prevented me from pursuing larger scale projects. This class and especially this final project pushed me to break through the aspects of programming that intimidated me creatively. I have never had to approach Unity3D with programming in mind. My expereince in the engine prior to this class was making sure 3D objects were textured and lighted correctly, terrain was textured correctly, or simple set dressing/fixing of terrain. I can say with full certainty after this class that I am a more confident programmer and although I can't say I am looking forward to encountering the bugs and errors I'll run into when adding more features to this game; I know that they won't stop me from continuing to develope it. I'm excited to keep developing this game and the ideas surrounding it in the near future. It is something I would love to eventually submit to conferences or potetially include in my thesis (how videogames are the ultimate medium to explore death and change how we think/cope with it is something I am considering as a thesis topic).
