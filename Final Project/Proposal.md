dp - Death Process (Title is just dp as to not compromise the users experience. The title is inspired by the Heptapods translation of dying from Denis Villeneuve's Arrival).
 
The player escorts a character experiencing the beginning, middle, and end of my thoughts on the process of dying. With some quotes from philosophers thrown in here and there.

Important mechanic - Player cannot move backwards. 
create an invisible wall that moves only when the character moves forward.  

**Beginning Stage** - Confusion, questioning what is happening and where they are going.

W..What happened... How did I get here?

What is this place?  

What a strange place. But I feel different. It feels like I am here and not here all at the same time. 

How am I moving? I can't control my body. How strange... It feels like something is pulling me. Guiding me. 

This place is beautiful but why am I so sad?

A door? I wonder where it leads to. Maybe I can get out of this weird place. 
 
**Middle Stage** - Panic/rejection fearing the worst... fearing that death is imminent. 

How did everything change so quickly?

I feel more present in this place. But I am weaker... 

I am getting weaker with every step I take. 

I don't know where I am going, but This doesn't feel right. I don't think I want to keep going. 

**End-Stage** - Acceptance... I know I am dying and this process can't be stopped. 

Thinks continue to look worse as I proceed 

Was my time spent meaningfully? Did I make a difference?

Did I spend my time the way I wanted?

Am I already dead now 

**Departure**
This is it, this is where I must go whether I like it or not. 
At least I'll know what is on the other side. 
*Fade out* 
Nothing... there's nothing. 
That's okay, I'm okay.
