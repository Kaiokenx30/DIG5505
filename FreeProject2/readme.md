I chose option 1 for the free project soley for its similarity to what I want to do for my final project. Creating randomly generated noise images serves as a great starting point for the potenital library of different types of noise I want to create in the final project. 

My main obstacle is creating differnt patterns that act as different noise types. I am able to make black and white/greyscale noise (which everything will be in the final project) and color noise. To create more interesting noise images that contain height information, I can manipulate the RGB noise images to greyscale. The shades of grey would then translate to different heights in a program like substance designer. 

One great thing about the current function I have that I will include in the final version is the ability to make the noise image any size the user may want. When building textures in substance designer the most common sizes are: 512x512, 1024x1024, and 2048x2048. 

One option that isn't the most efficient but could be explored is creating smaller noise images and then scaling them up to create interesting large shapes. 

I will continue to try and make different shapes with my current function and explore other ways to create noise images.

One thing I would like a better understanding of is where I am able to add mathematical procedure to my functions. I would like to be able change the size or shape of what is being placed when I use put.pixel, or is there another way I should be approaching that aspect of image creation entirely. I found a sources online to create shapes using PIL but is there a better way to do this?
