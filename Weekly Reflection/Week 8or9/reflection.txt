Chapter 10 was an interesting look at the functionality of some very fundatmental elements of image
analysis and manipulation. Some of which I have used for years in image editors.
It was very interesting to learn about how those functionalities worked at a 
basic level. 

As much as I enjoyed learning the basics I felt like there could have been a heavier focus
practicing elements of PIL that didn't return an error or worked 100%.
For example: Montfort spent plenty of time in the last section going over flipping an image, 
however it didn't return the desired result. When he did cover obtaining the 
desired result he simply stated: "So, what’s needed isn’t additional work, but less work. Instead of iterating over
range(width), how about iterating over half of that interval?". Ideally it would have been great 
to see an example of what he meant. 

This chapter and our class did inspire me with an idea for our final project. 
As someone who has spent many hours working in substance designer creating procedurally 
generated textures, I saw a great opportunity to create something that could help 
people get started with the texture they want to make. Creating a tool that provided 
artists with different types of noise images (different from what is included in substance)
that are categorized based on what they are texturing could be a successful learning experience 
for those either just starting out or inspiring a starting point.
